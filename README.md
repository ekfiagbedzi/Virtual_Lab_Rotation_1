This notebook contains analysis code that sought to analyze the relationship among tissues and proteins based on protein expression.

It uses the dimensionality reduction algorithms TSNE from `sklearn.manifold` library as well UMAP from umap.
Key arguments used include `perplexity=2, 15` for TSNE and `n_neighbors=2, 15`
